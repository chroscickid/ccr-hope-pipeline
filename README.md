## Background
At the University of North Florida (UNF), students studying Information Systems are required to take a Community-Based Transformational Learning (CBTL) course. This project is the result of the collaboration between four UNF students, IT professionals from Florida Blue (mentors), Center for Children's Rights (client) and Karthikeyan Umapathy (instructor).

## About Center for Children's Rights
Their mission is to advance the rights of children through legal advocacy, policy and practice transformation, and restorative justice.  They believe that every kid can thrive if they have access to the right supports and services; are connected to the right people, places, and opportunities for their development; and when they are treated equitably.

The Center for Children's Rights, is a 501(c)(3) corporation that is committed to helping disenfranchised youth in Duval county get back on their feet through legal representation, juvenile justice reform, and restorative justice. 


## Goals of the Project
The goal of this project is to develop a management system for The Center for Children's Rights to keep track of their forms. Before this solution, CCR was using Excel and Google Docs to keep track of referrals from the community and Excel for tracking forms that included additional information about the student. Our solution has three main features: referral and tracking forms, a notification system, and report generation. The report generation will make it more efficient for them when writing grants for funding.

## Technologies
For this project, we used a number of technologies and platforms. 

We used Microsoft Visual Studio to create the software program. Our charts and graphs for the reporting system are generated using a free Javascript tool called “Plotly”. File hosting for when clients wish to upload additional documentation with a referral form is shared using Blob hosting. SendGrid is utilized for sending comfirmation emails, and notifications for new referrals that have been created.The Asp.Net Core project is being hosted on Microsoft Azure servers, which also includes a SQL server and database, where we’re storing our data. Additionally, we used Git and GitHub to help with collaboration and version control of the project, and Jira to keep track of user stories and other tasks.
